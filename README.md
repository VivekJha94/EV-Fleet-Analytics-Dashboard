# EV Fleet Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
EV Fleet Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze the operational performance and cost efficiency of an Electric Vehicle (EV) fleet.  

The dashboard enables monitoring of trip activity, charging costs, maintenance expenses, and overall vehicle efficiency to support data-driven fleet management decisions.

---
## Objectives
- Monitor total fleet distance and trip activity  
- Track charging and maintenance expenses  
- Calculate cost per kilometer for each vehicle  
- Compare efficiency (km per kWh) across vehicles  
- Identify high operating cost vehicles  

---

## Key Metrics Implemented
- Total Distance (km)  
- Total Trips  
- Total Charging Cost (Rs)  
- Total Maintenance Cost (Rs)  
- Cost per Km  
- Efficiency (km per kWh)  

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – Data Visualization  
- **DAX** – KPI and metric calculations  
- **PostgreSQL** – Data storage and structuring  
- **Excel** – Data preparation
